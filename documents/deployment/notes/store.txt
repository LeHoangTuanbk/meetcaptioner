## Privacy & Permissions (for Chrome Web Store form)

### Single Purpose Description
```
MeetCaptioner captures and displays real-time captions from Google Meet meetings with AI-powered translation. It provides a floating overlay showing original captions alongside translations, helping users understand multilingual conversations and save meeting transcripts.
```

### Storage Permission Justification
```
The storage permission is required to:
1. Save user preferences (API provider, model selection, target language)
2. Store API keys locally for translation services
3. Auto-save meeting captions and translations for later review in Meeting History
4. Preserve custom translation prompts configured by the user
All data is stored locally on the user's device and never transmitted to external servers.
```

### Host Permission Justification (meet.google.com)
```
The host permission for meet.google.com is essential because:
1. The extension must inject a content script to detect and capture live captions displayed during Google Meet calls
2. It needs to read the caption text, speaker names, and timestamps from the Meet interface
3. The floating overlay must be rendered on the Meet page for users to see translations alongside the video call
Without this permission, the extension cannot access or display captions from Google Meet.
```

### Host Permission Justification (api.anthropic.com, api.openai.com)
```
These API endpoints are required for AI translation:
1. api.anthropic.com - Users who choose Anthropic as their provider send caption text here for translation using their own API key
2. api.openai.com - Users who choose OpenAI as their provider send caption text here for translation using their own API key
Users must provide their own API keys. No data is sent without user configuration and explicit consent.
```
